                    <p><strong>Horacio Pagani</strong> (born 10 November 1955) is the founder and CEO of Pagani Automobili S.p.A., the awesome Italian exotic car creator behind the likes of the <em>Zonda</em> and <em>Huayra</em>.</p>
                    <p>From humble roots in Argentina (his father was a baker), he was obsessed with cars from a young age. In 1983, he moved to Italy to pursue his dream of building a supercar, joining <strong>Lamborghini</strong>, where he later built the Countach Evoluzione, a concept car with heavy carbon fiber throughout.</p>
                    <p>When Lamborghini refused to buy an autoclave, it signaled the end of his career there.</p>
                    <p>In 1991, he started his own consultancy, Modena Design, focused on making carbon fiber composites for Formula One cars. Shortly after, in 1992, he founded Pagani Automobili Modena. It took seven years for the Zonda to be ready.</p>
